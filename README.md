# Key Insights

1. Customer Order Patterns:

Significant variation observed in cost of orders and delivery times across different cuisine types and days of the week.
Certain cuisines tend to have higher average order costs, indicating premium pricing or larger order sizes.

2. Delivery Time Analysis:

Delivery times are influenced by the day of the week, with weekends showing longer delivery durations, potentially due to increased order volumes.
Lower-rated orders often correlate with longer delivery times.

3. Correlation Insights:

A strong correlation exists between delivery time and food preparation time, highlighting logistical dependencies.
Cost of the order shows minimal correlation with delivery time, suggesting consistent pricing strategies irrespective of delivery duration.
